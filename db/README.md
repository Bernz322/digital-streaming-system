# Usage

The app will have no data initially. Please populate it with the given JSON files by importing them in MongoDB.

<li>If you decide to not import anything, the first user to be registered will be automatically set as the root admin (cannot be edited nor deleted). </li>
<li>If you decide to import all JSON files, the root admin password is 'root1234'. For the other users, it will be 'firstName + 1234' (user1234 or faye1234)</li>
<li>You can also import the Actors, Movies and Moviecast JSON only.</li>
